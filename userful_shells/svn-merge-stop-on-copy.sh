Usage: ${PROG} <source branch> [target branch]
svn merge commit between verison when source branch copy(--stop-on-copy)
and head version of source branch.
Source branch must be a remote branch.

Example: 
	${PROG} http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature1
	# merge http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature1 to current svn direcotry

	${PROG} http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature1 /path/to/svn/direcotry
	# merge branch http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature1 to svn direcotry /path/to/svn/direcotry
	# will prompt comfirm for committing to target branch.

	${PROG} http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature1 http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature2
	# merge http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature1 to branch http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature2
	# because http://www.foo.com/project1/branches/feature2 is remote url,
	# will check out target branch to tmp direcotry, and prompt comfirm for committing to target branch.
